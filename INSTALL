== DEPENDENCIES ==

 MPI HDF5 SWIG CMake
 All dependencies except CMake are optional.

== INSTALL == 1.) Windows 2.) Mac OS X 3.) Linux

== Windows ==

 Virtual Quake currently does not support Windows.

== Mac OS X ==

 With the OS X default Python.

 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make

 If you have a third party installation of python (ie. from Homebrew or
 MacPorts) Virtual Quake will build and install, but the Python QuakeLib
 module may not work. This is because CMake builds against the system Python.
 You can explicitly specify the Python installation to use with the following
 flags and example paths:

 cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/opt/local/bin/python \
       -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/opt/local/lib/libpython2.7.dylib \
       -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/ ..

 Then run make as usual.

== Linux ==

 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make

== CLEAN RE-BUILD ==

 Just delete the build directory and re-install based on the instructions above.
