QuakeLib Library
-------------

Provides tools and a Python interface to develop earthquake simulations,
read/write EqSim format files for geometry, friction, initial conditions and
events, and calculate Okada's functions for different fault configurations.

NOTE FOR MAC USERS:

By default the Mac system may not find the correct libpython for the default
Python installation.  To correct this, you can specify the correct library in cmake like:

cmake -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/opt/local/lib/libpython2.7.dylib ..
